# Summary

A very simple javafx application that draws some shapes on the screen.  As my first javafx application that I have built, I utilized a few different ways of drawing shapes through... 
    * drawing on the canvas directly
    * adding shapes explicitly to the scene
    * building shapes using the corresponding Builder class (now deprecated but I like the design pattern)

# Build and Execute

mvn package
mvn exec:java
